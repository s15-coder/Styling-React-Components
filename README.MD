# Styling CSS React

### Working with vanilla CSS in React

**Pros**

- Decouple CSS code from JSX code.
- Allow developers only working on CSS without having to worry about the other code.

**Cons**

- CSS code is not scoped to components -> it means that the a class with the same name may clash if it has been defined in different components.
